  "description": "In the depths of the Black Forest, where twisted oaks weep dark sap and thorny vines whisper ancient secrets, reality bends like shadows in candlelight. Mist-shrouded paths lead to gingerbread cottages that smell suspiciously of burned sugar and old bones, while ravens with human eyes deliver messages written in silver thread. The locals speak in riddles, trading wishes for firstborn children, and every full moon the sound of golden slippers dancing on grave soil echoes through the valleys. Here, grandmothers sharpen their teeth behind lace curtains, and children who wander off the path return changed - if they return at all. Among the roots of ancient trees lie forgotten crowns and cursed spindles, waiting for unwary fingers to draw fresh blood.",

      "long_description": "Three ancient oaks have grown together here, their massive trunks twisting around each other like braided hair, creating a natural archway where the forest paths converge. Their branches stretch overhead like gnarled fingers, dripping dark sap that catches the weak sunlight and glimmers like garnets. A weathered signpost leans at an odd angle, its wooden arrows pointing in contradicting directions, the text carved in them seeming to shift when viewed directly.",
