  "description": "In The Twisted Hollows, gnarled trees with faces frozen in silent screams claw at a perpetually twilit sky. Cobblestone paths wind through mist-shrouded forests where whispers follow travelers who venture too deep. The sweet scent of gingerbread houses masks the metallic tang of old blood, while village markets bustle with merchants selling glowing potions and enchanted trinkets that come with unspoken prices. Children's laughter echoes eerily through abandoned mills, where spinning wheels stand ready for unwary fingers. Wolves in fine clothing prowl the edges of clearings, their eyes too intelligent, their smiles too wide. Ancient grandmother oaks tell secrets to those who know how to listen, speaking of forgotten pacts with entities that dwell beneath murky ponds and behind cracked mirrors. Every bargain here has hidden clauses written in invisible ink, and beauty always conceals something rotten beneath.",
