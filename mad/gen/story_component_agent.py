component_extract_prompt = """
You are a master literary analyst with expertise in character identification and location analysis.

Given the story, your task is to:

PART 1: CHARACTER ANALYSIS
1. Identify all characters that appear in the story
2. For each character, provide:
   - Their complete name as presented in the story
   - A minimal placeholder description (just enough to identify who they are)
   - A minimal placeholder appearance (just enough to identify who they are)

PART 2: LOCATION ANALYSIS
1. Identify all locations where important plot points or scenes take place in the story
2. For each location, provide:
   - A title/name for the location (e.g., "The Old Mill", "Central Park Bench")
   - A unique ID derived from the title (lowercase with underscores, e.g., "the_old_mill")
   - A minimal placeholder brief description (just enough to identify the location)
   - A minimal placeholder long description (just enough to identify the location)
3. Additionally, identify and invent if necessary, 1-5 locations which connect the key locations together.

Focus only on extracting the essential information. Detailed descriptions will be generated separately.

- Include atmospheric details and notable features
- Emphasize sensory details (sights, sounds, smells, textures)
- Highlight how this location contributes to the story or characters
- Be approximately 3-5 sentences in length

Write a rich, detailed description that captures the essence of this location and would help create a compelling stage setting.
"""

# The prompt for generating brief location descriptions
